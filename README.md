# Using Jekyll with Pages

This site uses Jekyll, a static website builder.  It is tightly integrated with Github Pages.

See https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages for more on using Jekyll with Github Pages.  Notably:

Execute
	
    bundle exec jekyll serve [--detach]

in the root directory to build and serve the page.  Use

    bundle exec build --watch &

to build only.  Use

    bundle update

in the root directory to update jekyll dependencies.

# Preparing Images

## Using ImageMagick to convert an image to another format:

    convert file.tif file.jpg

## Using ImageMagick to resize a file (for e.g. creating thumbnails):

    convert -resize x100 file.jpg file_thumb.jpg

## Examples

    rename "s/ /-/" *
   
    for fn in `ls -1 *tif`; do pref=`echo $fn | awk 'BEGIN {FS="."};{print $1}'`; convert $pref.tif $pref.jpg; done

    for fn in `ls -1 *jpg`; do pref=`echo $fn | awk 'BEGIN {FS="."};{print $1}'`; convert -resize x100 ${pref}.jpg ${pref}_thumb.jpg; done

    for fn in `ls -1 halloween*.jpg`; do echo $fn; mv $fn ${fn//halloween/2008-10-31-CMIA-halloween_}; done
