      <title>How to have a Severn River Friendly Yard</title>
      <link>http://carrolltonmanor.github.io/2014/02/05/how-to-have-a-severn-friendly-yard/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://carrolltonmanor.github.io/2014/02/05/how-to-have-a-severn-friendly-yard</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are so many things you can do to help the Severn River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rain-barrels&quot;&gt;Rain Barrels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install a rain barrel under the gutter of your home to har-
vest rain water from your home’s roof. This prevents
stormwater, the number one pollutant, from entering the
Severn River. Why is this important? There is an amaz-
ing amount of pollutant living on our roofs and during a
rain storm, these pollutants are mixed with rain water and
washed down into ditches and directly into the Severn
River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full zoomable&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-02-05-how-to-have-a-severn-friendly-yard/rain-barrel.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you also know that the lawn and garden uses 40% of
household water during the growing season? A rain barrel
will help reduce this usage! The water collected can be
used for watering flower beds and gardens. If every CMIA
household had two 50 gallon rain barrels each (CMIA has
approximately 550 homes), 55,000 gallons of stormwater
water pollutants would be prevented from entering the
river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a rain barrel are:
* Conserving Water
* Prevention of contaminated stormwater from entering the Severn River
* Helps prevent erosion
* Helps prevent flooding
* Very pretty landscape feature
* Provides water for your plants and gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install a rain barrel, all you typically need is a 55 gallon
drum rain barrel, a vinyl hose, PVC couplings, and a
screen to keep our debris
and insects (very important to keep our mosquito
population down).
Rain Barrels can be purchased at major retailers
like Ace Hardware, Sam’s
Club, Home Depot, Arlington Echo, Plow &amp;amp;
Hearth, Amazon.com,
and Rainbarrel-source.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rain-gardens&quot;&gt;Rain Gardens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain Gardens are another very important way to help improve the water quality of the Severn River and Chesa-
peake Bay. Rain gardens beautiful functioning gardens
that allows rain water runoff from impervious surfaces
such as roofs, driveways, and parking lots to be absorbed.
Rain gardens prevent stormwater from entering our waterways. Native Maryland plants are recommended for rain
gardens because they do not require fertilizer and are already adapted to our climate and soil conditions. Additionally, native plants attract local wildlife.
In order to install a rain garden, the following checklist
should be completed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to see if a grading permit is needed for your
property (greater than 5000 sq ft)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the Ph of your soil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine what type of soil amendments are needed, for example Leafgro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dig and plant your garden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rain garden should not take more than one to two days
to install. More information can be found at the link above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A note from our President</title>
      <link>http://carrolltonmanor.github.io/2014/02/03/a-note-from-our-president/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://carrolltonmanor.github.io/2014/02/03/a-note-from-our-president</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is almost spring and if you think like me, you are longing to get outside to play.  Please look inside the Spring 2014 issue of the Eagle for some important community announcements. 
You’ll also find news about the following upcoming community events such as the annual CMIA key day, yard and plant sale, and Easter egg hunt. 
We are also currently planning for the community beautification/planting day.. Volunteers are always needed. More details are inside. Additionally, we are thinking about entering a
float in the annual Severna Park July 4th parade — we just need people to organize it.
Plan on coming to the next community meeting to learn about and/or volunteer for any
of these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please- all our community activities, projects and events need your support. The Board is only a handful of people and we are trying to keep the “Improvement” in C-M-I-A, 
but WE NEED YOU to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As winter warms up into spring- we have the ‘ever repeated’ reminders: Do a
little bit to clean up some winter waste around the neighborhood. &lt;strong&gt;DRIVE SAFE AND
SLOW&lt;/strong&gt; - watch out for all our residents — small and tall — that are starting to come
out and play. Help to keep Carrollton Manor a safe and happy place to live. I look for-
ward to seeing you at the March 4th meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Handling of Yard Waste</title>
      <link>http://carrolltonmanor.github.io/2014/02/02/handling-of-yard-waste/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://carrolltonmanor.github.io/2014/02/02/handling-of-yard-waste</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spring is on its way!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that
 said, yard waste and tree trimmings
should be composted or placed at the
curb for pick up, not dumped on
CMIA Community Property. You
may think it is only leaves, but it
builds up into debris and becomes
trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working hard to beautify our neighborhood. Anything
dumped on East Drive, Severn Rd,
Park Rd, and the woods at Hillbottom can become our responsibility to
cleanup.
The community has had to deal with,
and sometimes pay for, the removal
of leaves, yard trash, and tree
branches on community property or
in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
